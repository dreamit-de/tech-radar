# Motivation

At [dreamIT](https://www.dreamit.de), we maintain a [public Tech
Radar](http://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/) to help our engineering teams
align on technology choices. Is is based on the [pioneering work
by ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) and adapted from [Zalando](http://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/).

This repository contains the code to generate the visualization. Data is automatically extracted from a provided Google Stylesheet, that we maintain. Entries are positioned automatically so that they don't overlap.


Feel free to use and adapt it for your own purposes.
